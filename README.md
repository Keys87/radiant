5. Type the command below to install all dependencies on `package.json`
```
npm i
```
6. After all packages are installed, type the command below to run **vite and tailwindcss**
```
npm run dev
```
7. Alternatively if step 6 **doesn't** work, you could:
```
npm run run-tailwind
```
and using another terminal window:
```
npm run dev
```
